# Rock Paper Scissors

In this project, I created a Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to build a simple and interactive game where the user can play against the computer.

Next, I implemented the game logic using JavaScript. I assigned click event listeners to the Rock, Paper, and Scissors buttons so that when the user selects one, it triggers the game's functionality. I also added a random selection function for the computer's choice.

Overall, the Rock Paper Scissors game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provides an engaging and interactive experience for users to play against the computer and enjoy the classic game.
